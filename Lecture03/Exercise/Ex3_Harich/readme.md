# Exercise 3: Enhancing the Memory Game with Arrays and Loops

## **Objective**
The goal of this exercise is to enhance the **Memory Game** using JavaScript **arrays and loops**. Students will use arrays to store card data, shuffle the cards, and track flipped cards. Loops will help dynamically render cards and manage repeated actions efficiently.

Successfully completing this exercise will earn **4 points**.

## **Task Description**

### **Task 1: Card Data Setup (1 Point)**
- [x] Define an array containing card symbols (e.g., emojis or numbers) with matching pairs.
- [x] Ensure that all cards have a corresponding match.

### **Task 2: Shuffling and Rendering the Cards (1 Point)**
- [x] Implement a shuffle function that randomizes the card order before the game starts.
- [x] Use JavaScript to generate and display the cards dynamically instead of hardcoding them in HTML.

### **Task 3: Implementing Flip Logic (1 Point)**
- [x] Track flipped cards using an array.
- [x] Ensure that only two cards can be flipped at a time.
- [x] If two flipped cards match, keep them visible; otherwise, flip them back after a short delay.

### **Task 4: Game Completion and Reset (1 Point)**
- [x] Track the number of matched pairs.
- [x] Display a message when all pairs have been successfully matched.
- [x] Implement a reset function that reshuffles the cards and resets the game state.

## **Achievement Criteria**
To successfully complete this exercise, students must:
1. Implement the card setup and shuffle functionality correctly.
2. Dynamically render the cards and attach appropriate event listeners.
3. Implement flip logic that allows matching and hiding cards appropriately.
4. Ensure the game tracks matched pairs, displays a win message, and provides a reset option.

## **Optional Enhancements**
For additional challenges, students can extend the Memory Game with:
- **Move Counter**: Track the number of attempts made by the player.
- **Game Timer**: Measure how long it takes to complete the game.
- **Visual Effects**: Add animations or color changes when cards are matched.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Allow the user to choose different grid sizes for increased complexity.

---

## **Submission Requirements**
- Submit the project as a **ZIP file via Moodle**.
- Ensure that all required files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are included.
- The submission must contain **clear documentation** explaining the implementation.

Good luck and happy coding!
